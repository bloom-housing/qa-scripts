## Who can Contribute

Anyone who has a tool or script they created and thinks others can benefit from. Scripts do not have to be specifically Bloom related but should somehow assist in the development or testing of Bloom related things.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Each script or tool will be organized into its own subfolder
- Each contribution will include a README located in that script's subfolder describing what it does and how to use it
- Reviews are encouraged but not required. Add a 'ready for review' tag and allow time for folks to review if they are interested.
- Each contribution should add the name with a link to the correct folder, and a brief description to the [Existing Scripts](#existing-scripts) section of this projects README
- Do not commit any secrets, passwords, keys or other sensitive information

## Maintenance

- If anyone comes across a script/tool that does not work they are encouraged to write up an issue to raise awareness of the problem
- Any tool/script that no longer functions should either be removed or updated with a fix
